# Keyboard
## Because I dont have a better name.

This is the keyboard firmware for my custom keyboard I have made. 

It is built for the teensy 2.0 microcontroller based of the [usb_keyboard demo project
by pjrc](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/usb_keyboard.html) with some help from 
[tmk_keyboard](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/).
